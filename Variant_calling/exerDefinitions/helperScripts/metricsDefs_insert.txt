MEDIAN_INSERT_SIZE	The MEDIAN insert size of all paired end reads where both ends mapped to the same chromosome.
MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION	The median absolute deviation of the distribution. If the distribution is essentially normal then the standard deviation can be estimated as ~1.4826 * MAD.
MIN_INSERT_SIZE	The minimum measured insert size. This is usually 1 and not very useful as it is likely artifactual.
MAX_INSERT_SIZE	The maximum measure insert size by alignment. This is usually very high representing either an artifact or possibly the presence of a structural re-arrangement.
MEAN_INSERT_SIZE	The mean insert size of the "core" of the distribution. Artefactual outliers in the distribution often cause calculation of nonsensical mean and stdev values. To avoid this the distribution is first trimmed to a "core" distribution of +/- N median absolute deviations around the median insert size. By default N=10, but this is configurable.
STANDARD_DEVIATION	Standard deviation of insert sizes over the "core" of the distrubution.
READ_PAIRS	The total number of read pairs that were examined in the entire distribution.
PAIR_ORIENTATION	The pair orientation of the reads in this data category.
WIDTH_OF_10_PERCENT	The "width" of the bins, centered around the median, that encompass 10% of all read pairs.
WIDTH_OF_20_PERCENT	The "width" of the bins, centered around the median, that encompass 20% of all read pairs.
WIDTH_OF_30_PERCENT	The "width" of the bins, centered around the median, that encompass 30% of all read pairs.
WIDTH_OF_40_PERCENT	The "width" of the bins, centered around the median, that encompass 40% of all read pairs.
WIDTH_OF_50_PERCENT	The "width" of the bins, centered around the median, that encompass 50% of all read pairs.
WIDTH_OF_60_PERCENT	The "width" of the bins, centered around the median, that encompass 60% of all read pairs.
WIDTH_OF_70_PERCENT	The "width" of the bins, centered around the median, that encompass 70% of all read pairs. This metric divided by 2 should approximate the standard deviation when the insert size distribution is a normal distribution.
WIDTH_OF_80_PERCENT	The "width" of the bins, centered around the median, that encompass 80% of all read pairs.
WIDTH_OF_90_PERCENT	The "width" of the bins, centered around the median, that encompass 90% of all read pairs.
WIDTH_OF_99_PERCENT	The "width" of the bins, centered around the median, that encompass 100% of all read pairs.
